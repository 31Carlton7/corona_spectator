## About

At first I didn't have the intentions of making Corona Spectator because I personally thought that Coronavirus wasn't as big of an issue as it was last year. However, after taking a look our current circumstances of the Delta Variant, I thought it was necessary to create it. An all in one solution to get all the coronavirus information and help you need is something I think everyone should have during the pandemic. It's a long fight and we all must endure. So I hope this app will help you stay safe üôèüèæ.

## Developer Info

The API's and sources I use to obtain my information are courtesy of [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), [CSSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), [Google News RSS Feed](https://news.google.com/rss?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en), and [Disease.sh](https://disease.sh/).
To build the app I utilized the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) as the UI Framework and that uses [Dartlang](https://dart.dev) as the programming language. The list of packages the app uses can be found [here](https://github.com/31Carlton7/corona_spectator/blob/master/pubspec.yaml) under the `dependencies` indent. This project is null safe. I also used Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to better understand the users who use the app. There is no form of authentication or database usage.
